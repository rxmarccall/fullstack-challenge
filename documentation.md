- Any instructions for us to run your code and understand your solution.

    Run frontend and server using `npm run dev`

- What decisions did you end up making?

    I used interfaces for model types as I really enjoy a more strongly typed code structure.
    I created an 'endpointHelper' to hold some of the boilerplate for api calls to keep the code cleaner.
    I used Material UI for frontend components as a quick goto solution for UI.

- What assumptions did you make?

    I had assumed as I followed instructions that I understood all the properties of the database models.
    As I read further I realized I needed to go back and add more properties like 'amount' and 'status'.

- What would you have done if you had more time?

    The styling of the frontend is as barebones as it gets.
    I would have liked to have spent much more time adding nice styling and formatting
    to make the data interesting to look at. 

    I also would have liked to come up with more creative names for the deals and organizations.

- Is there any feedback/questions you have for us?

    I was a little confused on expectations on the database data. Will you be creating your own data
    or am I supposed to include it in the delivered project?

    I ran into an issue where the frontend was not hitting port 3000 for api requests and wasn't sure why
    so I ended up needing to hardcode the local url with port 3000 to get unblocked.
